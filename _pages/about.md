I am a researcher working mainly in the area of probability theory. I am currently an Assistant Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Technological University Dublin. I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki and received my PhD from the University of Oxford.

Most of my research so far has focused on the geometry of smooth Gaussian fields. I have collaborated with [Dmitry Beliaev](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/belyaev/), [Stephen Muirhead](https://stephenmuirhead.wordpress.com/), [Antti Kupiainen](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/antti-kupiainen), [Eero Saksman](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/eero-saksman) and [David Wells](https://dawells.github.io/).
