For a smooth, stationary, planar Gaussian field, we consider the number of connected components of its excursion set (or level set) contained in a large square of area \\(R^2\\). The mean number of components is known to be of order \\(R^2\\) for generic fields and all levels. We show that for certain fields with positive spectral density near the origin (including the Bargmann-Fock field), and for certain levels \\(\ell\\), these random variables have fluctuations of order at least $R$, and hence variance of order at least \\(R^2\\). In particular this holds for excursion sets when \\(\ell\\) is in some neighbourhood of zero, and it holds for excursion/level sets when \\(\ell\\) is sufficiently large. We prove stronger fluctuation lower bounds of order \\(R^\alpha\\), \\(\alpha \in [1,2]\\), in the case that the spectral density has a singularity at the origin. Finally we show that the number of excursion/level sets for the Random Plane Wave at certain levels has fluctuations of order at least \\(R^{3/2}\\), and hence variance of order at least \\(R^3\\). We expect that these bounds are of the correct order, at least for generic levels.
